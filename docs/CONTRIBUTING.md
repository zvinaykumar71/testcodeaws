# How to contribute

Thank you to all our contributors for participating in this project! !

My name is Seki, who is the head of development. If you have any questions, feel free to ask us a question on Slack or other sites!

We will tell those who will participate in the development of this site how to participate.

## Comments on Issue and Pull Request

*Feel free to comment on the issue! We also accept new questions and suggestions.
*When adding an issue, make sure you search for a similar issue already before creating it.
*When sending a Pull Request, be sure to add the corresponding issue number. Single pull requests are not accepted.
*Please note that issues with improved (improvement suggestions) cannot always be reflected
*Related parties must confirm anything that changes the meaning of content, such as changes in the wording or significant appearance. Thank you for your understanding.
*As the issue with the `waiting` label is being checked by the relevant parties, it is safer to avoid implementing it until the contents are solidified.
*It would be helpful if you prioritize good first issue /help wanted /bug

## How to participate in communication
*If you do not have a Code for Japan Slack account, please register here (https://cfjslackin.herokuapp.com/)
*Please join the `#proj-stopcovid19hokkaido` channel.

## When participating
*Please read the [Principle/Code of Conduct] (./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in development.
*For communication, please also check Code for Japan's Code of Conduct (https://github.com/codeforjapan/codeofconduct).
*If no one has assigned an issue you can do, please comment on the issue by saying "I'll do it!" before starting development.
*[Good first issue with labels] (https://github.com/codeforjapan/remote-patient-monitoring/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue) is recommended for beginners
*If you are likely to leave work for more than half a day, make sure others can take over the work. (If you turn off for a long time while holding the issue, that issue will be blocked.)
*We may remove the assign for issues that are not updated for more than one day. Even during the process, if you send me a [Draft Pull Request](https://qiita.com/tatane616/items/13da1b6797a7b871ad58) it will be easier to understand your movements.
*For questions related to issues, please use the comments in the issue from Slack.
*We also accept proposals! Proactively create new issues.
