# The background to the need for this system

Currently, with the increase in COVID-19 patients in Hokkaido, the number of patients undergoing home recuperation or accommodation treatment is increasing.

Reference: [Nearly 10 times the number of people treated at home, almost 2 months ago, COVID-19 (NHK)] (https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20201223/k10012780161000.html)

> Meanwhile, there have been cases where their condition suddenly changes while he is being treated at home or institutions, and this month a man in his 50s who was recuperating at a lodging facility in Kanagawa Prefecture, and another man in his 60s who was waiting to be hospitalized at his home in Hiroshima Prefecture, have died.

As mentioned in the above article, it is necessary to grasp the patient's situation in a timely manner.
In Hokkaido, pulse oximeters will be distributed to home/hospital patients, so we will create a system in which patients will register the oxygen saturation, pulse, body temperature and other symptoms obtained from this.

We will also develop a monitoring dashboard where the information obtained there can be viewed in a list at the health center where the patient is in charge.
For specifications, see [System Specifications] (SPECIFICATION.md).
